The web2py is installed inside my folder in the server. To start web2py from my server:
1. navigate to /home/jliou/web2py
2. type “python web2py.py -—ip 159.203.233.58 -e”

This will get web2py up and running and you can access the login page from:
http://159.203.233.58:8000/hello/default/user/login on a web browser.

As for a simple GET request, you can type:
http://159.203.233.58:8000/hello/default/api/hello/1.json
