	- Errors -> Faults -> Failures

		- Tests designed to check system-internal behavior
		- Test coverage: relative to system components (at various levels)
			- e.g. statements, execution paths, conditions, classes, packages, etc.
		- Coverage criteria: for White box testing defined via control flow graph.
